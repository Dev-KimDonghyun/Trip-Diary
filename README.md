# Trip Diary [Development Discontinued]

Dev-KimDonghyun's Personal Full-Stack Project

## Reason for Discontinuation

- Development began without proper documentation, making it difficult to expand and maintain features.
- As the project grew, maintaining code structure and consistency became increasingly difficult.
- Recognizing the need for document-driven development, future projects will be properly planned and documented before implementation.

## Retrospective

- **Experience:**  
  Through this project, I directly experienced the issues that arise from developing without specifications or plansâ€”unclear requirements, confusing code structure, and poor maintainability.
- **Lesson Learned:**  
  All projects should start with careful planning and clear specifications.
- **Next Action:**  
  My next project will begin with a thorough documentation process, including functional specifications and API design.
